  👨‍💻 gatsby-dev-portfolio
</h1>

A simple starter to get your dev portfolio up and running quickly with Gatsby.

## 🚀 Quick start

This project uses _[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)_ in the backend as a Headless CMS.
That's why, I've created a separate _[repo](https://github.com/eneax/gatsby-dev-portfolio-api)_ containing the setup to run the project locally.

Make sure to clone the _[Strapi backend repo](https://github.com/eneax/gatsby-dev-portfolio-api)_ first and run it locally:

```shell
  npm i
  npm run develop
```

Once the backend is running, then run this repo locally with:

```shell
  npm i
  gatsby develop
```
